# Machine Learning: Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems

These are my notes on the Coursera course by Andrew Ng ["Machine Learning"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

For setup and general information, please look at `../README.md`.

This file my notes related to an **OCR application example***.

Note that Latex formulae are not always rendered in Markdown readers; for instance, they are not rendered on Github, but they are on VS Code with the Markup All In One plugin.
Therefore, I provide a pseudocode of the most important equations.
An alternative would be to use Asciidoc, but rendering of equations is not straightforward either.
