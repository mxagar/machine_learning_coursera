# Machine Learning

These are my notes on the Coursera course by Andrew Ng ["Machine Learning"](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

The course is divided in 11 learning weeks which cover several topics from Machine Learning:

- Week 1: Introduction, Linear Regression
- Week 2
- Week 3
- Week 4
- Week 5
- Week 6
- Week 7
- Week 8
- Week 9
- Week 10
- Week 11

I divided the course in topic folders, which do not necessarly match the learning weeks.
Each folder contains my notes on the topic as well as course material: slides, scripts, notebooks, etc.

- `01_LinearRegression/`
- `02_LogisticRegression/`
